##Preamble

The Node.dc community is diverse, representing a broad spectrum of backgrounds, experience levels, skill sets, and personal beliefs. In this diversity is strength.  In recognition of this fact, we have created a Code of Conduct to be followed during all events, online dicussions, and code projects (including issue discussions and pull requests).

Node.dc is not an employer, nor does it maintain a workplace as defined by federal law.  However, we use the following as guides to define harassment:

* [Title VII of the Civil Rights Act](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm)
* [The Americans with Disabilities Act](http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm)
* [The Age Discrimination in Employment Act](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adea.cfm)


#The Node.DC Code Of Conduct

*Node.dc is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, age, or religion.

We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form.  This includes but is not limited to:

* Harassing speech, to include sign language and gestures
* Unwanted physical contact
* Offensive materials, whether printed, auditory, digital, or on articles of clothing
* Advances of a sexual nature, regardless of the orientation or gender of the parties involved

All community members affirm their commitment to upholding a harassment-free experience, and also acknowledge a personal responsibility to bring to the attention of the community any potentially harassing activity.*

## Additional Notes

Any activity that is identified as harassment by a community member or observer, whether in person, online, or by proxy, is subject to review by the community.  There is no time limit placed on identification or review of any activity identified as harassment.

Sponsors of community events are also subject to this Code Of Conduct.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community with no refund, if applicable.  Actions taken by community organizers do not preclude additional legal or civil action as defined in the laws and statutes applicable to the location and venue at which the behavior occurs.

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a community organizer should speak to the presenter afterward. However, the community organizers should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say “I’m sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time” with no further explanation.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance, and want you to feel comfortable, safe, and supported.

Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from events and the online meetup community without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the community organizers.

We expect participants and organizers to follow these rules at all community venues and community-related social events.

It is through thoughtful dialog and careful listening that we can encourage each other to do great things. We are committed to making Node.dc a place where you can develop and share your skills, both as they relate to programming and to communication.

> “Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.” ― Dalai Lama XIV
